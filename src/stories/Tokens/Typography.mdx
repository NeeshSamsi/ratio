# Typography

Typography gives voice to content, shaping readability and establishing a clear visual hierarchy. Our typographic system is intentionally designed to create an inviting and focused reading experience, supporting clear communication and expressive potential.

## Primitive Size Tokens

These tokens define the foundational scale for all text, offering a proportional and harmonious range of sizes. Utilize this core typographic ladder to build consistent, legible, and visually balanced text elements throughout your interfaces.

## Primitive Weight Tokens

These tokens define the available font weights, providing the necessary variations to create emphasis and differentiate elements within your typographic structure. Use them to craft nuanced, clear, and impactful textual communication.

## Semantic Size Tokens

Semantic size tokens assign specific typographic styles—combining size, weight, and line height—to common UI roles such as headlines and body text. Apply these to ensure consistent information hierarchy and appropriate emphasis for different content types effortlessly.
