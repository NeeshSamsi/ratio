# Foundations

Welcome to Ratio, VSCO's Design System!

The name Ratio reflects balance, proportion and creativity. It lays the foundations for compelling photography and effective design. Ratio signifies a system that empowers precise, harmonious creation, enabling our community to frame their unique visions with clarity and expressive freedom, embodying our Creator First approach.

VSCO's Ratio UI is driven by our four core principles: **Creator First**, **Inviting**, **Inspiring**, and **Intentionality**.

These principles are the bedrock of our commitment to supporting human creativity through technology, ensuring every aspect of Ratio aligns with VSCO's mission to foster an authentic, supportive, and visually rich creative environment.

For designers, Ratio offers the elements and guidance to craft visually distinct, Creator-First interfaces that are inherently Inviting and Inspiring. For developers, it provides a robust, well-documented set of components to build performant, engaging, and scalable applications that bring these Intentional creative visions to life. Together, let's deliver superior user experiences that align with VSCO's mission to nurture and celebrate authentic human creativity in a supportive community.

## Creator-First

It's a community-driven platform. We believe in supporting human creativity and maintaining an authentic creative environment at the heart of new technology.

## Inviting

We use clear, human-centered patterns and warm, accessible design to create an open space where every creator feels welcome to explore, connect, and share their unique perspective.

## Inspiring

We spark creative momentum by showcasing diverse artistic visions and providing tools that encourage bold experimentation, pushing the boundaries of self-expression and visual storytelling.

## Intentional

Intentionality means clarity, focus, and flow. It means creating tools that feel seamless and natural, so users can stay in their creative zone. Itâ€™s about reducing noise and honouring attention because we believe that thoughtful design empowers thoughtful creation.
