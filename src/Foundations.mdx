# Foundations

Welcome to Ratio, VSCO's Design System!

The name Ratio reflects balance, proportion and creativity. It lays the foundations for compelling photography and effective design. Ratio signifies a system that empowers precise, harmonious creation, enabling our community to frame their unique visions with clarity and expressive freedom, embodying our Creator First approach.

VSCO's Ratio UI is driven by our four core principles: **Creator First**, **Inviting**, **Inspiring**, and **Intentionality**.

These principles are the bedrock of our commitment to supporting human creativity through technology, ensuring every aspect of Ratio aligns with VSCO's mission to foster an authentic, supportive, and visually rich creative environment.

For designers, Ratio offers the elements and guidance to craft visually distinct, Creator-First interfaces that are inherently Inviting and Inspiring. For developers, it provides a robust, well-documented set of components to build performant, engaging, and scalable applications that bring these Intentional creative visions to life. Together, let's deliver superior user experiences that align with VSCO's mission to nurture and celebrate authentic human creativity in a supportive community.

## Creator-First

We’re a community-driven platform centered around the needs of real creators not algorithms or advertisers. VSCO believes in encouraging creativity, collaboration, and authentic self-expression. Our community uplifts original work and supports experimentation. With features like VSCO Spaces, users can connect in smaller, interest-based groups, fostering meaningful conversations and shared inspiration.

## Inviting

We use clear, human-centered design and warm, intuitive interfaces to create a space that feels open, inviting, and accessible to all creators. Every element is designed to support ease of use and self-expression, making it simple for users to explore, connect, and share their unique perspective. It’s about building an environment where creativity feels natural and everyone feels like they belong.

## Inspiring

We spark creative momentum by showcasing diverse artistic visions and providing tools that encourage bold experimentation, pushing the boundaries of self-expression and visual storytelling.

## Intentional

Intentionality means clarity, focus, and flow. It’s about crafting tools that feel seamless and natural, so users can stay fully immersed in their creative process without interruption. By minimizing distractions and respecting users’ attention, VSCO ensures that thoughtful design becomes a foundation for deeper, more meaningful creation.
