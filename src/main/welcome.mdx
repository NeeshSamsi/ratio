# Welcome to Ratio UI

This project was completed as fulfillment of the course Design Systems for Interactive Systems taught by [Pablo Deeleman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pablodeeleman/) at Harbour.Space University (Barcelona).

Ratio is a design system providing a comprehensive set of reusable components and clear guidelines for building consistent, accessible, and intentionally crafted user interfaces. It is deeply inspired by VSCO's commitment to fostering a supportive and inspiring environment for creators.
