# Voice and Tone

## Voice: Creator-first, Warm, Clear

- Always center human creativity and authenticity.
- Speak to the user as a fellow creator. Use an empathetic, encouraging, and accessible voice.

## Tone: Context-Aware

- Encouraging and enthusiastic for creative tasks (e.g., learning photography, building a portfolio).
- Supportive and instructive for functional moments (e.g., tooltips, errors).
- Neutral and clear for technical or instructional documentation.

## Language Principles

### Do:

Use everyday, human-centered language.

↳ “Tap to explore styles” instead of “Initiate style exploration.”

Be intentional and concise.

↳ “Adjust contrast” instead of “Modify the image’s contrast settings.”

Align with creative workflows.

↳ “Refine your shot” or “Showcase your vision.”

Use active voice and direct guidance.

↳ “Select a reference image to get started.”

Favor inclusive and non-technical language when speaking to beginners.

Celebrate experimentation and expression in CTAs and prompts.

↳ “Try a bold new look” > “Apply filter.”

## Don't:

Use jargon, overly technical or academic language.

↳ Avoid terms like “parametric values” or “non-destructive pipeline” in UI copy.

Talk down to users or assume skill level.

↳ Don’t say “simple” or “easy” — say “accessible” or “clear.”

Overload interfaces with copy or unnecessary tooltips.

Add decorative or marketing-style language that doesn't support action or clarity.

### UX Copy Patterns

**Buttons & CTAs**

_Be clear and expressive:_

↳ Do: “Upload Portfolio Image”
↳ Don’t: “Submit”

**Tooltips**

_Brief and helpful:_

↳ Do: “Drag to crop your photo”
↳ Don’t: “This feature allows for image resizing and aspect ratio adjustment.”

**Empty States**

_Encourage creativity and reassure:_

↳ “Your space is waiting. Start sharing your perspective.”

**Onboarding / Help**

_Support discovery and confidence:_

↳ “Let’s explore how light shapes your photos.”
↳ “Need help picking a lens? We’ve got tips.”

### Accessibility & Inclusion

- Always write with accessibility in mind: clear labels, predictable flow, screen reader-friendly copy.
- Support internationalization by avoiding idioms or culture-specific slang.
- Embrace neutral, inclusive pronouns (e.g., “their” instead of “his/her”).
