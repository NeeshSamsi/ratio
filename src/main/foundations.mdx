We’re a community-driven platform centered around the needs of real creators not algorithms or advertisers. VSCO believes in encouraging creativity, collaboration, and authentic self-expression. Our community uplifts original work and supports experimentation. With features like VSCO Spaces, users can connect in smaller, interest-based groups, fostering meaningful conversations and shared inspiration.

Every element is designed to support ease of use and self-expression, making it simple for users to explore, connect, and share their unique perspective. It’s about building an environment where creativity feels natural and everyone feels like they belong.

### Inspiring

We spark creative momentum by showcasing diverse artistic visions and providing tools that encourage bold experimentation, pushing the boundaries of self-expression and visual storytelling.

Intentionality means clarity, focus, and flow. It’s about crafting tools that feel seamless and natural, so users can stay fully immersed in their creative process without interruption. By minimizing distractions and respecting users’ attention, VSCO ensures that thoughtful design becomes a foundation for deeper, more meaningful creation.
